# Diagnostics (doctor)

`/bin/doctor` is a read-only support command for "what is wrong with
this container?" moments. It does not run `restic init`, `restic
unlock`, backups, restores, replicate jobs, hooks, mail or webhooks. It
only inspects the current environment and mounted files, then exits
non-zero when it finds hard failures that would also break normal
operation.

| Section | Information |
| --- | --- |
| **Runtime** | Release, hostname, current time, `TZ`, `restic version`, `rclone version`, `bash --version`. |
| **Effective environment** | Masked values of `RESTIC_REPOSITORY`, `REPLICATE_JOB_FILE`, mail/webhook URLs, etc. Legacy `SYNC_*` values are shown with a deprecation warning when they still override `REPLICATE_*`. |
| **Configuration checks** | `RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` exists and is readable; `RCLONE_CONFIG` and `RESTIC_CACERT` are readable when set; `BACKUP_ROOT_DIR` exists; `--files-from` and `--exclude-file` paths referenced from `RESTIC_JOB_ARGS` exist; cache / temp / log / metrics directories are writable. |
| **Repository probe** | Non-mutating `restic cat config`. Exit 10 is reported as "repository missing/not initialized"; doctor never initializes it. The probe output is masked before printing. |
| **Replicate** | Effective `REPLICATE_*` values and validation of `REPLICATE_JOB_FILE` rows (`SOURCE;DESTINATION[;MODE[;EXTRA_ARGS]]`) with endpoints masked. |
| **Hooks** | Each known hook path is listed with executable status (`executable`, `not executable`, `not found`). |
| **Recent JSON summaries** | The latest `last-{backup,check,prune,replicate,restore,snapshot-export,forget-preview,mount-snapshot}.json` content if present. |
| **Recent cron log** | Last 40 lines of `/var/log/cron.log`. |
| **Summary** | `warnings: N`, `errors: N`. Exit non-zero only on errors. |

## Quick start

```shell
docker exec -ti restic-backup-helper /bin/doctor
```

Or as a one-shot via `docker run`, without an existing container:

```shell
docker run --rm \
  --env-file restic.env \
  -v ./config:/config:ro \
  -v ./restic.password:/run/secrets/restic_password:ro \
  marc0janssen/restic-backup-helper:latest \
  doctor
```

The `doctor` entrypoint subcommand short-circuits cron startup and
exec's `/bin/doctor` directly.

## Exit codes

| Exit | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | No hard errors. There may still be warnings (e.g. legacy `SYNC_*`, missing `MAILX_RCPT` when you expected mail). |
| `1` | At least one hard error. Examples: missing repository settings, unreadable required secrets / config, empty `RESTIC_TAG`, no backup paths, failed repository probe. |

## When to run it

- **After every config change.** Catches typos, mis-mounted secrets,
  unreadable `rclone.conf` before they show up as a failed cron job.
- **Before opening an issue / support ticket.** The output is a
  ready-made support bundle.
- **As a CI step.** Run `doctor` in a smoke-test job to validate the
  full env / mount surface without writing data.
- **As a health probe**, when a strong probe is overkill. The Docker
  `HEALTHCHECK` example uses `restic cat config` directly because it is
  cheaper.

## Output safety

Because `/bin/doctor` prints configured paths and non-secret job
arguments, treat its output as **operationally sensitive**. The
following are masked or hidden by the helper:

- **Repository URLs** — `mask_repository` replaces userinfo with `***`.
- **Replicate source/destination URLs** — `mask_endpoint` handles inline
  credentials.
- **Webhook URLs** — only `scheme://host/...` is printed.
- **Restic / OpenStack / mail passwords** — never echoed.
- **`WEBHOOK_HEADER_AUTH`** — never echoed; doctor only mentions "auth
  header set".

`RESTIC_JOB_ARGS`, `RESTIC_FORGET_ARGS`, `RESTIC_PRUNE_ARGS` and
`REPLICATE_JOB_ARGS` are printed verbatim because they are
caller-controlled. Avoid stuffing secrets into them — use a
`RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE` and `--password-command` files instead.
